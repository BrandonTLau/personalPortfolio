    <h1>School Project: Passenger Airlines Seating Chart</h1>

    <div class="project-details">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project was developed during my internship and involves creating a system to manage passenger seating assignments on an airplane. The goal was to design a flexible and efficient seating chart system that could adapt to various seating configurations.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Dynamic Seating Management: Adjust seating arrangements based on user input.</li>
            <li>Flexible Input Options: Seating assignment via console or file reading.</li>
            <li>Visualization: Provides a text-based visualization of seating assignments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <p>The Passenger Airlines Seating Chart system was implemented using C++. The project includes the following components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dynamic arrays to handle variable seating capacities.</li>
            <li>Functions to assign and display seating based on user preferences.</li>
            <li>File I/O for importing and exporting seating arrangements.</li>
        </ul>
